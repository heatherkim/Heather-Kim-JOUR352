  In 1999, two young men killed 12 students and wounded 24 others at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado. The incident sparked a long series of school shootings in the United States that has continues to this day.Not a single year has passed since 1999 without at least five school shootings in the U.S. There have been at least 214 school shootings since Columbine, according to newly released data by The Washington Post that examines school shootings at secondary and primary schools in the U.S since the Columbine shooting.<br>

 <p>
At least five school school shootings have occurred every year since 1999, with an average number of 11 shootings per-year.  2006 and 2014 had the highest number of incidents with fifteen and sixteen school shootings, respectively. As can be seen the chart below, the past three years have remained consistently high, with at least a dozen incidents each year.

 <p>
131 people have been killed in school shooting incidents in the United States since the Columbine massacre in 1999. The two deadliest years since have been 2012, when 26 people were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School, and 2018, when 21 people were killed at Parkland High School. The chart below compared the number of people killed, the number of the people injured and the number of incidents by year since 1999.

The surviving victims of school shootings are increasingly putting pressure on state and national legislators to pass stricter gun control laws and take action on mass shootings. This video from The New York Times features school shooting survivors talking about their desire to see action taken by lawmakers.<br>

 <p>The vast majority of school shooters are young white men.<br>

According to the data collected by the Post, 95 percent of school shooters were male. Similarly, most shooters were white; 55 percent of school shooters were white and 33 percent were black, as seen in the chart below. The average age of school shooters is 19 years old. Four of the school shooters were under 10-years-old and fourteen were over 40. Most shooters were students or former students of the school where the shooting occured.<br><br>

Beyond their demographic profiles, there is debate about the common characteristics of school shooters. For example, though mental illness and childhood abuse are often cited as causes, the exact role these issues play is widely debated. One common characteristic, according to an FBI report about school shooters, is that shooters share their plans with at least one other person in around 80 percent of cases.<br><br>

Dr. George S. Everly, Jr. of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine says that shooters are often motivated by anger and revenge. They tend to be socially awkward, isolated and suffer from a lack of adult supervision. He also spoke of the effects of media contagion, or copycat killings, on school shooters.</p>

 <p>
The two most deadly shootings in modern American history occurred within the last few years. The Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting killed 26 people. The shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School killed 17. The deadliest school shooting in U.S. history occurred in 1927 in Bath Township, Michigan when a school board treasurer killed 38 elementary school students and six adults.</p>
