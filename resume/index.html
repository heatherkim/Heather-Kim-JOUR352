      <p class="description"> <strong>Student & Photojournalist</strong>

      <p class="description">I am currently a junior Broadcast Journalism major and Asian American Studies minor at the University of Maryland, College Park. I am an aspiring photojournalist bent on capturing the stories of those that I encounter. I am always looking for more opportunities to build my portfolio and expand my skillset. Not to be dramatic, but I would die for more diversity in photojournalism, some good mozzarella, and every dog that I pass on campus.</p>

      <div class="sectionheader">Experience:</div>
        <div id="jobtitle">Science Desk Multimedia Intern</div>
        <div class="organization">NPR</div>
        <div class="date">Sept - Dec 2018</div>
        <p class="description">I assisted the Science Desk with editing photos, videos, charts and infographics for science, global health and food coverage on NPR.org. I also helped the NPR Visuals Team when needed such as with midterm election coverage and photographing tiny desk concerts. I edited staff and freelancer photos and helped build web pages and multimedia elements.</p>

        <div id="jobtitle">Photo Editor</div>
        <div class="organization">M Mag</div>
        <div class="date">Feb 2017 - Present</div>
        <p class="description">I photograph for the University of Maryland’s only on-campus fashion magazine. My responsibilities include collaborating with creatives in the DMV area. This usually entails traveling off campus, conducting a 1-2 hour photoshoot and editing hundreds of photos in time before seasonal publication. Besides shooting cover stories, I also pitch and execute original content for the magazine.</p>

        <div id="jobtitle">Videographer</div>
        <div class="organization">SB2W Citikidz</div>
        <div class="date">June - Aug 2017/2018</div>
        <p class="description">I created highlight videos that documented the experiences of over 500 campers, all of whom came from inner-cities around the east coast. I recorded, edited and produced these videos by myself and shared these videos weekly across social media platforms to direct more traffic to the camp’s site and garner more attention for the camp in general.</p>
